    "In this representation, each word is thought of as corresponding to a number in `{1, 2, ..., V}` where `V` is the size of our vocabulary. And each sentence is represented as a V-dimensional vector $x$, where $x_i$ is the number of times that word $i$ occurs in the sentence.\n",

We will cap the number of features at 4500, meaning a word will make it into our vocabulary only if it is one of the 4500 most common words in the corpus. This is often a useful step as it can weed out spelling mistakes and words which occur too infrequently to be useful.\n",
